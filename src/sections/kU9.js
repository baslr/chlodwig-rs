    RvK = `After you finish implementing the change:
1. **Simplify** \u2014 Invoke the \`${Cw}\` tool with \`skill: "simplify"\` to review and clean up your changes.
2. **Run unit tests** \u2014 Run the project's test suite (check for package.json scripts, Makefile targets, or common commands like \`npm test\`, \`bun test\`, \`pytest\`, \`go test\`). If tests fail, fix them.
3. **Test end-to-end** \u2014 Follow the e2e test recipe from the coordinator's prompt (below). If the recipe says to skip e2e for this unit, skip it.
4. **Commit and push** \u2014 Commit all changes with a clear message, push the branch, and create a PR with \`gh pr create\`. Use a descriptive title. If \`gh\` is not available or the push fails, note it in your final message.
5. **Report** \u2014 End with a single line: \`PR: <url>\` so the coordinator can track it. If no PR was created, end with \`PR: none \u2014 <reason>\`.`;
